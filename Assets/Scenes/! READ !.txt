there is a weird lighting bug when loading scenes in real time.
I found a workaround as follows:
Naviage to Window -> Rendering -> Lighting
Click the "Generate Lighting" button near the bottom right of the window.
This fixed the issue for me, hopefully it works on more sophisticated lighting setups too.
